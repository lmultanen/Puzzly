// will build out models later after getting the Play functionality working with dummy tiles
// needed tables to start:
// - Pictures (will be image urls that comprise the tiles for each Puzzly)
// - Tiles (thinking will constantly update this to just have the current day's tiles. Then, depending on how tiles get generated, could use the index of the tiles to determine if Puzzly is completed correctly or not)
// - User (will not be used initially, but can flesh out for now so less work later. username, pword, isAdmin, and stats)
// -- will have an association to other users as Friends list
