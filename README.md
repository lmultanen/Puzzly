Try Puzzly now at https://www.puzzly.us

This repository contains the code for Puzzly, a daily picture-based game where users will race against the clock to assemble the given tiles back into a full, coherent picture.

To start, users will be able to share their time for the Puzzly of the day. Later, functionality will be added to find and add friends to view each other's times on their own personalized leaderboards. Additionally, users will also be able to see their statistics for their completes Puzzlys (such as current completion streak, total Puzzlys solved, and average solve time).

The goal of this project is to showcase my skills as a developer while picking up a couple new tools along the way. Hopefully, once completed I will be able to convince my friends to add it to our current rotation of Wordle and the Daily Mini!
